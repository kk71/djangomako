djangomako
==========

a simple mako template connector for django.

for django's template is so weak and so dumb, somewhere i've found a django__mako connector which is embedded into django's template. but after that admin template is no longer support. And it's not support for python3.

So here comes my connector which works more directly and it provides two functions to take place of django's own function with the same function name and arguments. Whats more i've designed a easy-to-use template debugger view.
